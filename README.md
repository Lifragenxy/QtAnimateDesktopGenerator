# QtAnimateDesktopGenerator

The steps for set-up on Windows x64 are as the following.

1. Download the code.
2. Use nuitka or other applicable "compliers" for python to turn the main file "play2.py" into an .exe. Make sure you have cv2 and Pyside2 pre-installed.
3. Place your background video to the same directory as that of "play2.py" and rename the video file as "video.mp4".If the video format is not mp4, convertion on CloudConvert is suggested.
4. Click "play2.exe" prepared in step 2. Your animate desktop should now be visible!
5. Use the "stop.bat" included to stop the program.

Thank you for trying out this:D
